# RetrospectiveTool
Agile/Scrum team anonymous retrospective tool
## Synopsis

This project was created to give Agile teams the ability to have anonymous retrospective meetings. Multiple teams can use the application at the same time by having their own sessionId's.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project was to replace a spreadsheet system for documenting retrospective comments/messages by Agile team members. The intent was to make the process anonymous (no application login needed and therefore no tracking of who is writing what) and simple.

## Installation
