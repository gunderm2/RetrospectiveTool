    <h2>RetrospectiveTool</h2>
    <p>Agile/Scrum team anonymous retrospective tool</p>


    <h3>Synopsis</h3>

    <p>This project was created to give Agile teams the ability to have anonymous retrospective meetings. Multiple teams can use the application at the same time by having their own sessionId's.</p>

    <h3>Motivation</h3>

    <p>The motivation for this project was to replace a spreadsheet system for documenting retrospective comments/messages by Agile team members. The intent was to make the process anonymous (no application login needed and therefore no tracking of who is writing what) and simple.</p>

    <h3>Installation</h3>

    <p>GitHub clone URL: https://github.com/gunderm2/RetrospectiveTool.git</p>
